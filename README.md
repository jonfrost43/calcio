This is a project to create a progressive web app (PWA) for following football tournaments.

Currently it runs best on Chrome for Android - add to homescreen for the PWA experience.

## todo
* Service worker needs to be implemented in order to trigger the 'Add to homescreen' notification.
* Cache requested HTML, CSS, JS and JSON for offline use.
* Set up MongoDB so API data can scale up easier.
